## 🌟 Vision & Overview
**H.E.A.L.E.R - A.P.S** is a state-of-the-art, hardware-integrated medical kiosk designed specifically for the **Army Public School (APS)** ecosystem. It serves as a 24/7 automated first-responder station, providing clinical-grade symptom screening and immediate dispensing of basic medications.

Our mission is to bridge the gap between symptom onset and medical intervention, ensuring that students and staff have access to safe, audited, and automated healthcare without delay.

## 🧠 The Diagnosis Engine: How It Works
The core of H.E.A.L.E.R is a **Multi-Track Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)**. Unlike simple chatbots, our engine follows strict medical branching logic modeled after standard triage protocols.

### 🛡️ Safety-First Philosophy
- **Red-Flag Prioritization:** Before any diagnosis is made, the system checks for "Life-Threatening Signals" (e.g., chest pain, respiratory distress, high fever >104°F). If detected, the system immediately halts and initiates an **Emergency Doctor Referral**.
- **The 4-Track System:**
  1. **Flu & Fever:** Differentiates between Common Flu, Seasonal Viral Fever, and serious infections.
  2. **Headache:** Identifies triggers like stress, hunger, or potentially serious neurological indicators (Migraine vs. Tension).
  3. **Gastric/Stomach:** Screens for acidity, food poisoning, and dehydration risks.
  4. **Skin & Allergy:** Analyzes rashes, fungal infections, and bacterial signals (includes camera-assisted capture).

### 📊 Accuracy & Reliability
- **Vetted Logic:** The diagnosis logic has undergone a rigorous bug audit (May 2026) to ensure paths like *Viral Fever* and *Bacterial Skin Infections* are correctly identified.
- **Medication Coverage:** The system handles standard treatments for:
  - **Fever:** Dolo 650, Crocin 500/250, Calpol Drops.
  - **Dehydration:** ORS Electral (age-specific mixing instructions).
  - **Allergy:** Cetirizine (Tablet/Syrup), Avil, Calamine.
  - **Infections:** T-Bact (Bacterial), Clotrimazole (Fungal).
- **Age-Appropriate Dosage:** Integrated `dosageRules.ts` ensures that a 7-year-old child and a 40-year-old adult receive different, safe quantities of the same medication.
- **Confidence Scoring:** Every diagnosis is accompanied by a confidence percentage (70%–95%) based on the specificity of the answers provided.
